# Velo Elevation Editor

This Node.js app will let you upload Garmin Training Center (.TCX) files.
It will then compare your elevation data with Google's elevation for each track point.
Then you can adjust the elevation accordingly adn export a new .TPX.

You can play with a [live instance](http://elevationeditor.nodejitsu.com/) of this app.
